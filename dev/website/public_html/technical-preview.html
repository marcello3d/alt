      <h1><strong>Foreword </strong></h1>
      <p>With the first Technical Preview release of the Cellosoft Alt Framework I felt it was necessary to write a short foreword for potential users.</p>
      <p>The Alt Framework is a new JavaScript-based web application framework built on top of Java Servlets.</p>
      <p>If you are anything like me, you would immediately be rolling your eyes and asking why someone went and made <em>another</em> framework. Keep reading and I will try to convince your eyes to stop rolling and start widening.</p>
      <p>With the current trend of &quot;Web 2.0&quot; and &quot;AJAX,&quot; and various other buzzwords (not to worry, I will refrain from using them), a thought occurs to me: if you are going to be writing lots of JavaScript for the client side, why not also use JavaScript on the server-side? (It occurred to me before all this Web 2.0/AJAX nonsense, but now it just seems all the more obvious.) </p>
      <p>JavaScript is a really neat functional language, and if you cannot already think of the advantages of using JavaScript to writing web applications (rapid development, a language web programmers already know, shared code between server and client, etc.), well then maybe you shouldn't be writing them.</p>
      <p>Although server-side JavaScript is not a new concept, I found it difficult to find application servers that did it <em>right</em>.</p>
      <p>After developing SQueaL, a XML-based SQL schematic system, and making the designs for Onion ML, a XML-based templating system, I came to the conclusion that despite my desire to not create a web application framework, I would end up writing one anyway. And that I might as well do it right.</p>
      <p>Thus the Alt Framework was born.</p>
      <p>I have approached designing the Alt Framework with a few rules.</p>
      <p>The first rule is to design for simplicity. The shortest, simplest, and most straightforward solution is often one of the best, and it tends to make design a lot easier.</p>
      <p>The second rule is to reuse. This rule has two meanings. The first is to use existing code and libraries that other people have written, <em>unless it holds you back</em>. The second meaning is to reuse ideas. Sharing concepts and approaches even across unrelated parts of a library make it easier to use.</p>
      <p>The last rule is to document. I think that one is self-explanitory.</p>
      <p>With those in mind I started developing the Alt Framework.</p>
      <p>Instead of writing a web server from scratch, I decided to build a Java Servlet and power it with Mozilla's Rhino JavaScript engine. This instantly gave me access to not only all the JavaScript features, but all the Java features as well.</p>
      <p>AltServlet, the servlet I created for the Alt Framework provides the foundation needed to execute modular JavaScript code. While AltServlet enforces a certain convention for modular code, aside from a few minor functional additions, it is essentially a thin layer that lets you write Java servlets in JavaScript.</p>
      <h2>Technical Preview</h2>
      <p>The Alt Framework technical preview is an alpha release. It is far from feature-complete, but demonstrates what the Alt Framework could be. </p>
      <p>The intention of this release is to generate interest. Instead of just talking at you like I have above, it provides a demo you can download and have running in a few minutes.</p>
