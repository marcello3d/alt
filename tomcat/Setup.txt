
RhinoServlet and Alt Framework on Apache Tomcat 5.5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting up RhinoServlet on Tomcat is fairly straightforward.  For the time being
there is not a special installation for Tomcat because it'd require duplicates 
of the files, but here's the basic structure:

Make a folder in your webapps directory (such as js, rhinoservlet, or ROOT):
      webapps/js/
      
All your scripts can be put directly in this folder, it will act as your root
scriptpath folder.  (So webapps/js/site/Foo.js would be loaded as site.Foo)

Make a subfolder WEB-INF for Tomcat configuration, a sample web.xml file is 
included and is a working starting point.  

      webapps/js/WEB-INF/
      webapps/js/WEB-INF/web.xml
      webapps/js/WEB-INF/lib/

If you are using Alt framework, put "alt.dictator.Main" as the "rhino.main" 
init parameter.

The WEB-INF/lib/ hosts all the Java packages you use.

For the core RhinoServlet, the .jars in alt/lib/core/ are needed.

For the Alt Framework, most of the .jars in alt/lib/ext/ are needed.

That should be everything!
